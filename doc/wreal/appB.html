<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035523"></a>Analog verification is based on the idea of simulating the circuit with a given input stimulus and observing the correct output behavior. In most cases, this process is still based on manual waveform inspections. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035524"></a>Necessary measurements and calculations on analog waveforms are sometimes hard to formulate in a mathematical way while manual check is very easy and fast for an experienced designer.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035525"></a>Waveform inspection is a major part of the analog workflow. People are simply used to eyeballing the results.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035526"></a>Analog design is not very formalized and still relies heavily on expert knowledge. This implies that there are significant amount of implicit assumptions beside the specification that need to be taken into account.</li></ul>


<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035527"></a>Even though a complete replacement of manual waveform inspection in analog design may not be realistic today, it is relatively easy to automate the straightforward checks in the analog working environment.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035528"></a>For example, the Virtuoso Analog Design Environment (ADE) is a very common workplace for analog designs. It provides an analog-centric verification suite using the following features:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035566"></a>Support for transient, DC, AC, and RF analysis</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035567"></a>Specification-driven design </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035568"></a>Supports multiple tests/analysis and measurement inside a single state</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035532"></a>Parasitic aware design flow</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035533"></a>Constraint-driven design</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035534"></a>Automatic characterization and model generation</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035535"></a>Integrated sizing and optimization capabilities</li><li>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035538"></a>The ability to automate the verification process combining a complete set of test benches, tests, and analyses into a single execution task is a huge productivity benefit for the analog designer. Combining this with a complete set of measurements checking the specification values, results in a simple but effective pass/fail summary for each specification value. A rich set of predefined checking functions and a straightforward scripting language allow users to implement circuit specific checks in a very efficient way. Moreover, the scripting language provides an easy and flexible way of automating the analog verification in the batch mode. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035539"></a>In analog design, device parameter variations due to the manufacturing process and changes in temperature, aging effects need to be taken into account. This is mainly ensured by sweeping parameter in a set of verification runs or by statistical methods, such as Monte Carlo and Corner analysis. These types of analyses are supported and used in ADE for many years.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035540"></a>The design data in the analog world is mostly organized in the design framework II (dfII) database. The blocks are categorized in libraries, cells, and views. Each cell in the design may have different representations &#8211; views. A graphical tool, namely Hierarchy Editor (HED), is used to bind each cell in the design to the appropriate view. The resulting configuration is saved as a cellview.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035542"></a>There are varieties of different analog solvers available. SPICE-level solvers, such as Spectre, Spectre RF, Spectre Turbo, and APS, are designed to solve the SPICE-level equations with the full analog accuracy. The fast SPICE engine, Ultrasim, on the contrary can trade off accuracy versus speed. Thus, the user can chose to reduce the accuracy level for some blocks, example, digital blocks, in order to gain simulation performance and capacity.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035543"></a>The simulation approaches in analog and digital domains are fundamentally different due to the structure of the underlying equation system to solve. While the digital solver is solving logical expressions in a sequential manner based on triggering events, the analog simulator must solve the entire analog system matrix at every simulation step. Each element in the analog design can have an instantaneous influence on any other element in the matrix and vice versa. Thus, there is no obvious signal flow in a particular direction. Time and values are continuous. In digital, time and values are discrete. The solver can apply a well-defined scheme of signal flow and events to solve the system.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035544"></a>This results in different run time complexities for the analog and digital solver. The digital event-based engines have an almost linear run-time complexity in terms of design elements. For example, a design that is twice as large as a reference would approximately consume the double simulation resources. In the contrary, the analog solver need to setup and invert the system matrix entirely. The matrix inversion has a run-time complexity slightly better than quadratic (depending on the algorithm used). Thus, an analog design of a double size needs more than four-time more simulation resources to be solved. This results in hard limitations for feasible circuit sizes for analog simulation. Tool enhancements, such as fast SPICE engines (Ultrasim) and parallel solving of the system matrix (APS) push these limits further away, however, the general trend remains. </p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-1035604"></a>Mixed-signal Simulators</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035547"></a>Commercial mixed-signal simulation solutions &#8211; like AMS Designer &#8211; are available since early nineties and the tools progressed over the last decade to powerful engines managing multiple power supply domains, bidirectional interface connections, varieties of analog solving algorithms. Mixed-signal extensions to the standard behavioral languages (Verilog-AMS and VHDL-AMS) provide flexible modeling capabilities. Given that, mixed-signal simulation in itself can be considered as a solved problem.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035548"></a>However, simulation is only the enabling part for the verification process. The verification environments are still separated in an analog driven flow or a digital-centric methodology as described above. The choice of the right level of design abstraction is especially important when moving to mixed-signal simulation.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035549"></a>Mixed-signal simulation is used mainly by the analog design team. Consequently, the use model is aligned with the analog workflow. AMS Designer is integrated in the ADE use model. It can read design information from the dfII database as well as file-based descriptions.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035550"></a>A significant demand for mixed-signal simulation within the digital use model has been visible over the last couple of years. AMS Designer&#8217;s command line use model fulfills these requirements. A simulation can be setup and started easily from the command line. This enables a straightforward integration into the digital-centric verification flow as well as all the flexibility needed for the mixed-signal simulation. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035592"></a>The analog content is in many design flows is represented only as Verilog-AMS or SPICE-level netlists. The goal was to make the flow as simple as possible, however, compared to a pure digital simulation, some additional information also need to be provided. </p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035471"></a>This appendix focuses on a generic outline of the digital verification flow in order to relate the important intersections with analog and to the challenges faced when bringing the two together for mixed-signal verification.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035472"></a>A simplified view of the digital verification flow as it applies to implementation is as listed below:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035473"></a>Functional verification through RTL simulation.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035474"></a>Equivalence checking of RTL and gate level.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035475"></a>Static timing analysis throughout the design.</li></ul>


<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035476"></a>The most costly as well as critical verification step at relatively high level of abstraction is the functional verification. Equivalence checking provides the verification against the synthesized gate design as well as other checks for structural, functional, and electrical integrity (refer to Conformal/CLP documentation for details). The timing of the final place and route implemented physical design is checked by the static timing analysis step.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035477"></a>Equivalence checking generates mathematical models of the two different circuit representations in order to determine the equivalence. There are some theoretical approaches to apply those techniques to analog design as well, but in general, this step is not related to mixed-signal verification.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035478"></a>Since static timing analysis is only applicable in context with a reference clock, it is not directly useful for analog blocks. However, it is important to consider analog parts when integrating the analog IP into a SoC, since the analog block might be part of a critical path through the design. This situation is solved either by running detailed performance simulations using mixed-signal tools to check the timing or by creating a timing model for the analog blocks and using this model during standard static timing analysis. Although there are characterization tools that build timing models for standard digital blocks, currently no standard tools will automatically build the regression suites and take the measurements needed for a timing model on analog IP. The method employed here is leveraging the analog design environment setting up automatic regression suite for each analog architecture and then having the analog environment generate the input data for the timing model.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035479"></a>Not long ago engineers wrote directed test cases, which were composed of simple sequences of &#8216;0&#8217;s&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217;s&#8217; as input stimulus for the design to do functional verification. Checking was done manually: it was part of the test and verification engineer&#8217;s task to explicitly predict the expected response of the DUT for a specific test. In some cases, it required even visual inspection of a waveform. Since this extra work had to be repeated for each and every testcase whenever there was a design change, engineers tended to minimize the amount of hard coded checks within their tests, increasing the risk of a bug escape. Configuration and reuse of those test benches were very limited. To track the verification progress, huge text documents or tables were used to handle the test implementation and results.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035480"></a>One of the biggest limitations of this method is the directed test approach. The designer is trying to test one specific feature of the specification in a dedicated test. Most likely, this test will pass without problems since the feature was implemented with the same set of implicit assumptions as the test. However, most errors occur when a condition is triggered in a non-standard way. This is the main reason why modern verification approaches are based on constraint random tests. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035481"></a>The challenge of digital functional verification comes down to answering the question of whether or not enough simulations have been run and all corner cases have been covered. Only additional measures, such as code coverage, assertion coverage, and functional coverage provide this information and enable an easy assessment of the current verification status. Finally, reuse and automation are much better supported in modern verification techniques (see below).</p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-1035483"></a><a id="_Toc234394677"></a>Verification Plan and Metric-driven Verification</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035484"></a>The process of creating a verification plan is initiated with a verification planning session. All parties involved in the design project should participate in the planning session to ensure that the plan does contain all needed information and the verification goals are agreed upon between the team members. The document describes what needs to be verified in a hierarchical way. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035485"></a>In most cases, the verification plan is a living document, which means the plan is refined, modified, enhanced during the design and verification process. This is a natural process since the design, spec, and experiences are changing during the design phase. Clearly defined verification goals are very helpful for the whole verification process, even if the goals are not formally written down in a verification plan.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035486"></a>Advanced verification techniques have been developed and introduced into today&#8217;s digital design flows to overcome the limitations and productivity restrictions. Moreover, the prediction of verification quality is a major improvement in the state of the art verification methods. Main components of these verification techniques are:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035487"></a>Automated random stimulus generation</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035488"></a>Automated self-checking (assertions and reference models)</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035489"></a>Coverage measurements and tracking</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035490"></a>Adding formal methods into the verification flow</li></ul>



<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035540"></a>The design under test (DUT) is stimulated with some input data, simulated, and the simulation results are stored. There are two important tasks:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035541"></a>Generation of input stimuli</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1035542"></a>Checking the results against expectations</li></ul>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035494"></a>A third task is functional coverage to measure which verification goals have been achieved during simulation. </p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-1035496"></a><a id="_Toc234394678"></a>Metric-driven Verification and Advanced Testbench</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1035497"></a>A metric-driven verification flow assembles the pieces together that have been discussed above. The simulation results are automatically checked and problems are being reported. An automatic stimuli generator creates tests on a random basis within given constraints. On top, the designer might have a certain amount of tests that are pre-defined and need to be run (directed tests) to reach certain corner cases. All of this is enabled by some advanced testbench that takes care of the different simulation scenarios. The testbench is typically written in e or SystemVerilog, whereas others use SystemC, Verilog, or VHDL as well.</p>

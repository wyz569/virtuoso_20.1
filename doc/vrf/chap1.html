<a id="pgfId-931160"></a>Virtuoso RF Solution enhances the capability of Virtuoso to create packages. Packaging involves translating the logical design (schematic) captured into a physical design ready for placement and routing using Layout EXL. You can create or modify package layouts in the presence of the package constraints. The package components can be placed and routed in Layout EXL. You can also edit shapes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-902382"></a><a id="25165"></a>Defining a Package</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-923405"></a>The package is an advanced environment for the physical layout of printed circuit boards (PCB). You can place and route a design, generate the output, and documentation necessary information for its manufacture. Layout EXL allows design considerations to be automatically incorporated into the physical design. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-923406"></a>In a typical package layout, you can place SMD Pcells corresponding to schematic components and T-line Pcells as a topology. The package layout views are placed with flight-lines to allow guided placement. For routing and placement in a package layout, abutment of RF-connect for RF routing, placement of GND/VCC shapes, addition of guides to place landing pads equidistant from each other, movement of other pads when one of them is moved, and placement of power rings for power pads is done.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-878514"></a><a id="15921"></a>Components of a Package </h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-919170"></a>Virtuoso RF Solution is a complete physical design and manufacturing verification solution for complex Virtuoso-based package design, including die bump array/BGA integration refinement using die abstracts. It supports all the popular package interconnect and assembly methodologies and provides comprehensive constraint-driven layout of the package substrate. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-923942"></a>This section presents an overview of the component design and die-to-I/O routing. Design technology for packages varies. Depending on certain needs, substrates can be laminate-based (organic), ceramic, thin film (silicon), or a combination of materials. These needs may be based on cost, performance, signal, and thermal considerations.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-923944"></a>Two important package components are, Land Grid Array (LGA) and BGA (Ball Grid Array). These are an array of chip connections, using surface-mount technology, in the form of solder balls.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-925725"></a>Bumps (IO pads)</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-926283"></a>To connect the dies, solder balls are placed on the top metal layer or on the backside metal layer. These solder balls and the metal pads beneath them are called bumps (IO Pads). Aligned IO pads between dies are called micro bumps or landing pads.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-925736"></a>Cross-die signals and power travel to adjacent dies through micro bumps. IO pads between a die and the package substrate are called flip-chip bumps. These are the solder joints on the IC. Look at the following bump cell to know about its components.</p>

<p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-925837"></a>This is a typical bump cell found in a PDK along with the cross-section.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-926273"></a>Through Silicon Vias (TSVs)</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-926274"></a>TSVs are copper vias with diameters ranging between 1 and 30 microns that pass through a silicon substrate.The top cap layer of a TSV is the first normal routing layer, Metal1, and the bottom cap layer of TSV is the backside metal layer. Therefore, TSVs enable signal propagation and power delivery between the top metal layer and the backside metal layer.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-926281"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="184" src="images/chap1-6.gif" /></div>
<h3>
<a id="pgfId-926285"></a>Silicon Interposers</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-926286"></a>Silicon interposers are electrical routing channels that help establish much finer die-to-die interconnections, thereby increasing the performance and reducing the power consumption. Silicon interposers are dies that can include TSVs to provide connections from the upper metal layers to additional backside metal layers. Also, for minimizing differences in thermal expansion and contraction because the materials are similar.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924707"></a><a id="94858"></a>Padstacks</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924673"></a>Each symbol pin in a design must have a padstack associated with it. The padstack describes how the symbol pin connects to each layer in the design. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924678"></a>A padstack is a file that contains the following information for each layer:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924680"></a>Pad size and shape</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924682"></a>Drill size and drill display figure</li></ul>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924684"></a>A padstack also describes the following information for the TOP and BOTTOM layers:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924686"></a>Soldermask</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924688"></a>Pastemask</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924690"></a>Filmmask</li></ul>


<p>
<a id="pgfId-924669"></a>A padstack can also contain Numerical Control (NC) drill data, which the layout editor uses to create drill drawings.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924260"></a>Stackup Information in Substrate</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924256"></a>The stackup information defines all the layers in the substrate that will be manufactured. This includes conductive layers, dielectric layers, paste layers, bond wires, pads, and shield planes.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924194"></a></p>

<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="227" src="images/chap1-7.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924289"></a>The information necessary to complete an accurate stackup includes material, layer type, name, thickness, dielectric constant, and electrical conductivity.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924290"></a>The stackup of a component is important, not only for the physical characteristics, but also for electrical and thermal characteristics. With proper stackup construction, electrical and thermal simulations can provide a more accurate analysis of behavior. Without it, results become skeptical at best. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924291"></a>The stackup also provides the z-axis aspect of the electrical design, allowing for accurate positioning of conductive trace layers, power/ground layers, bond wire information, I/O pin position, and z-axis connections between trace layers or to a power or ground plane. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924292"></a>Information required for stackup modeling includes:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924293"></a>Layer <ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924294"></a>Location </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924295"></a>Material</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924296"></a>Type (conductive, dielectric, shield)</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924297"></a>Identifier or name</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924298"></a>Thickness</li></ul></li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924299"></a>Electrical conductivity</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924300"></a>Dielectric constant</li></ul>








<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-924324"></a>Layer Thickness</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924325"></a>The overall thickness of the component is usually known and should be specified within the mechanical detailed information. Thickness is based on the number of layers required for the design. For example, a component may require 8 layers: 2 routing and 6 power/ground. The total thickness is the thickness of the 9 dielectric layers plus 8 layers of conductive material. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924326"></a>Individual layer thicknesses can be derived from the manufacturing data supplied by the foundry. You enter thickness data when you define the layer stackup.</p>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-924327"></a>Layer Materials</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924328"></a>You should, at this point, know which materials to use for each of the conductive and dielectric layers. Material type is important to define the electrical characteristics of the component. You define these characteristics by specifying the electrical conductivity, and dielectric constant. However, you should obtain the exact specifications for the material through the manufacturing foundry, check them against the ECAD tool-generated values, and tune them to the manufacturing specification. </p>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-924329"></a>Layer Type</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924330"></a>You specify a layer type to define the purpose the layer serves in the component design. Dielectric, conductive, plane, and bond wire are the most commonly used layer types, however, your design may require others. The significance of the layer type to the ECAD system is to specify effects (shield planes, design rule checking, and manufacturing output) for signal analysis.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924610"></a>Wafer-Level Packaging</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924611"></a>During manufacturing, dies are generally created in batches where many dies are created on one wafer board. When the dies are laid out on the wafer, a space is left between each die boundary so that the scriber can cut the individual dies. This space (scribe area) is wide enough for the saw blade to pass through without affecting the components on the die. When a saw cuts, it removes a channel on the material it is cutting. The figure below shows the scribe area between dies on a wafer board.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924621"></a>Previously, when you created an Edit-in-Concert die in an IC tool (or imported the die), its physical extents were based on the design extents from the IC design tool, not the actual physical qualities of the die. Yet, you need to consider these actual physical extents when placing dies in a component substrate layout. You must use them for any measurement, clearance, assembly, or placement rule checks that you perform in the component substrate design. This is particularly important in situations, such as measuring the clearance between the 3D path of a bond wire and the edge of the die, or the distance between closely-spaced components. If you do not use the actual die size (including the scribe area), you may place components too closely together in the layout design and, at the time of manufacturing, that will conflict with the placement of other components. </p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-924823"></a><a id="28323"></a>Packaging Concepts</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924845"></a>This topic describes the framework required to create packages. </p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924331"></a>Template Files</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924332"></a>Providing stackup information results in more accurate thermal and signal analysis, design rule checking, and ready-to-manufacture routing. Once completed, stackup information can often be stored in an ASCII file format (template file) that is recognized by the ECAD system.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924333"></a>Template files store a wealth of information that can then be reused on other similar designs to reduce setup time and effort.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924335"></a><a id="12063"></a>Constraint Definition</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924337"></a>With the physical modeling of the component substrate complete, the next phase is to set up constraints. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924338"></a>Constraints fall into two categories: physical and electrical. Physical constraints are driven by manufacturing guidelines, though electrical rules may impact the physical rules. For example, an electrical rule may be a 50-ohm line impedance that translates into a 4-mil trace width. Electrical rules are engineering-driven and are imposed to ensure signal quality and overall component performance. </p>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-924340"></a>Physical Constraints</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924341"></a>Physical constraints can be further broken down into two categories: Physical (Line and Via sizes) and Spacing (Line, Via, Pad, and shape spacings). Again, most of the physical rules are driven by manufacturing specifications, though some latitude may be given depending on the foundry. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924342"></a>You can also assign physical constraints to specific nets or groups of nets (net classes). Net classes allow you to specify different line widths, via sizes, and element-to-element spacing to the entire group or to a specific area layer of the component substrate.</p>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-924343"></a>Electrical Constraints</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924344"></a>Electrical constraints can be divided into two categories that are commonly lumped together: delay and distortion (D&amp;D). Delay refers to the interconnect delays introduced by the physical layout, typically in terms of nanoseconds (ns). Distortion refers to sources of noise caused by the physical layout, such as undershoot or crosstalk. Distortion is measured in millivolts (mV). </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924345"></a>You should divide signals in the layout into unique net classes based on performance requirements, for example, clocks and buses. Each constraint set would have its own noise budget and, therefore, corresponding distortion (overshoot, undershoot, crosstalk, and so on) constraints. For each net class, you also define timing constraints, such as delay and matched delay. In addition to defining electrical constraints, you should define any thermal constraints.</p>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-924346"></a>Template Files</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924347"></a>The effort involved in setting up all of the required constraints in a design may seem cumbersome and time consuming. Technology files allow you to dump out an ASCII representation of all defined constraints, which you can then import into other designs. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924348"></a>Technology files include:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924349"></a>Net classes</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924350"></a>Physical constraints</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924351"></a>Electrical constraints</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924352"></a>Stackup Information</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924353"></a>Design size, units, and origin</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924354"></a>Special attributes and properties created within the design</li></ul>





<p>
<a id="pgfId-924355"></a>Although every design has some unique requirements, template files can minimize the constraint definition effort by allowing you to modify an existing data file rather than starting a new file. </p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924357"></a><a id="13877"></a>Placement</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924358"></a>This phase is for defining the locations of the design elements with respect to the package. While there may be only a few elements to place, this can be difficult because of geometric restrictions of the substrate, such as cavities or geometric centering between all of the component I/Os. </p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924362"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="490" height="327" src="images/chap1-9.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924363"></a>If the component has multiple die, some latitude may be given to the designer for placement. In this situation, the designer is responsible for optimizing for die-to-die interconnect while at the same time optimizing for die-to-component fanout routing. </p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924364"></a>Die-to-Die Placement</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924365"></a>For die-to-die placement optimization, the designer should attempt to minimize crossing of signals between die and the number of signals that pass through another die to reach its destination. To accomplish this, you should attempt to rotate dies, align dies that interconnect with each other, and place dies relatively close to each other to optimize the routing real estate. In most cases, however, component designers do not have much freedom in die rotation and placement. Therefore, if you cannot achieve optimized routing with imposed placement, it is best to consult with the logic and manufacturing engineers before making changes.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924366"></a>Die-to-Component Placement</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924367"></a>For die-to-component placement optimization, die should be placed as close to the geometric center of the component as possible. If multiple dies are used, each die that connects to the component should be placed so that the die&#8217;s I/O is on the outside edges, close to the component edge, and no obstructions exist between the die and the component I/O.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924368"></a>You should carefully place signals that require performance constraints, such as delay or crosstalk, or require special routing. Acknowledging these requirements allows for optimized real estate to handle discrete components.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924370"></a><a id="57472"></a>Thermal Analysis</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924371"></a>Once you have placed components and defined constraints and stackup, you can perform thermal analysis. In this phase, you use thermal analysis to predict the junction and case temperatures within the component being designed. Through thermal analysis, you can quickly identify component temperatures that violate constraint criteria.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924372"></a>You can rectify thermal violations by applying one or more of the following corrective measures:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924373"></a>Modify die placement, if multiples are being used</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924374"></a>Add plane layers to the stackup</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924375"></a>Use alternative substrate materials</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924376"></a>Add thermal vias</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924377"></a>Add heat sinks</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924378"></a>Experiment with alternative boundary conditions (estimate performance under various environmental conditions)</li></ul>





<p>
<a id="pgfId-924379"></a>You can apply these measures in multiple &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios to arrive at an optimal solution.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924380"></a>Since junction temperature also impacts buffer drive characteristics, this information is important for the Pre-Route Signal Integrity Analysis phase, described later.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924382"></a><a id="11415"></a>Die-to-Component I/O Net Assignment</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924384"></a>At this phase of component design, the only logic in the design database is the die and, in the case of FCMs, the die-to-die interconnect. This provides for efficient component design because die-to-component logic can be optimized only after you have defined the component description and placement. Without either piece, component I/O assignment becomes a blind exercise that results in poor interconnect efficiency. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924385"></a>With only die logic defined, you can optimize I/O assignment for routing and performance with minimization of interconnect length and logic criss-crossing.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924386"></a>Pin Assignment</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924387"></a>The first step in optimizing pin assignment is to determine which component I/Os feed power and ground connections. Most companies preassign pins in a netlist. The power/ground pin assignment determines the remaining available component pins that can be used for signal assignment. Of course, there must be enough I/O pins remaining to accommodate the number of signal I/Os.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924388"></a>Priority Nets</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924389"></a>Prior to signal pin assignment, you should identify critical signals as priority connections. Depending on performance requirements, these signals may need to be the &#8220;shortest possible distance&#8221; to the component I/O, in which case manual pin assignment may be required. Many ECAD systems allow you to attach a special attribute to a net that requires a priority connection. </p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924390"></a>Routing Concerns</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924391"></a>Although the signal may require the shortest possible assignment, you must also consider routing. If the resulting shortest assignment results in connectivity crossing, you may need an additional routing layer. If an additional layer is not possible (or desired), you should make an assignment that selects the closest component I/O that also minimizes any signal crossing.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924281"></a>For general component I/O assignment, a utility should be available that scans both the die and the component I/O, take into consideration power, ground, and priority signals, and develop an optimized die-to-component netlist. Optimization should be based on overall routing capability of the component. For multiple dies, this process may be incremental. During each step, you select the die I/O of one or more dies and direct the assignment to a specific location of the component. Otherwise, poor assignment may result.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-925498"></a>Voiding and Connectivity</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-925544"></a>Voiding helps designers route on the ground/power planes by insulating signal nets automatically. You need to specify the ground/power planes to provide reference planes for transmission lines. In addition, it reduces the impedance of the power/ground supply network and EM noise.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-925540"></a>The signals going through ground/power planes are also required to route between signal layers separated by the planes.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924565"></a>Die-to-Component Interconnect</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924566"></a>Die-to-Component interconnect involves fanning out all of the die-to-component interconnections and routing to the destination component pin. Depending on the technology being implemented, this routing may take on different forms: </p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924567"></a>Routing patterns for Quad Flat Packs (QFP) and Pin Grid Arrays (PGA) are typically a triangular fanout pattern from the bond wire pads coupled with an &#8220;any angle&#8221; connection to the component pin. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924568"></a>Routing patterns for Ball Grid Arrays (BGA) are typically an intricate weaving of traces through the flip-chip pin locations to an edge pattern of vias coupled with an intricate pattern into BGA ball locations.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924569"></a>Routing patterns are a result of an optimized usage of routing real estate, resulting in the minimum number of routing layers. </li></ul>


<p>
<a id="pgfId-924570"></a>Interactive routing is more suited for intricate routing patterns. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924571"></a>ECAD systems offer a host of interactive routing capabilities that you can use to semi-automatically build fanout patterns and then complete with &#8220;any angle&#8221; routing. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924572"></a>Through graphical representations of connectivity lines and online design rule checking, routing efficiency is easily realized as manufacturing concerns are minimized.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-924573"></a>Die to Die Interconnect</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924574"></a>When routing among dies, you must identify critical signals (clock, high speed buses) and route them first. Once you have routed critical signals, you can run signal analysis. Then, model the actual routed traces. You can use the new interconnect delays to verify that the timing budget has been met. Finally, you can edit the routed traces to reach the desired level of signal integrity for the critical signals.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-924579"></a>You must specify manufacturing rules prior to routing. These rules include:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-924580"></a>Spacing (by layer, if applicable)</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924581"></a>Line widths</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924582"></a>Line impedance</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924583"></a>Legal via selection</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924584"></a>Blind and buried via spacing</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-924585"></a>Min/Max stagger size</li></ul>






<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-924586"></a>Power and Ground Vias</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-924587"></a>You must also route <em>power</em> and <em>ground</em> via connections. Depending on the type of design, you may route them before or after you route the signals. You must consider the via type (blind, buried, through) and the specific plane to which they attach.</p>

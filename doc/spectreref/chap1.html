<h4>
<a id="pgfId-1038768"></a>Wireless Analysis</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1038802"></a>The modern mobile platform with exponentially evolving wireless standards is increasing the complexity of wireless RFIC designs. To meet specification requirements and productivity goals, you must evaluate the system-level performance metrics in an integrated, automated, and easy-to-use simulation-based flow.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1038811"></a>Spectre RF wireless analysis feature provides a fully automated flow integrated in Virtuoso ADE, enabling you to apply the standard-compliant modulation sources and measure the output to calculate system-level performance.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1038932"></a>The MathWorks Simulink interface to Spectre Circuit Simulator offers system and circuit designers a unique integrated environment for design and verification. Designers can insert their analog and RF schematics and post-layout netlist directly in the system-level block diagram and run a co-simulation between Simulink and Spectre technologies. Designers can reuse the same Simulink testbench from system-level design to post-layout verification, minimizing unnecessary format conversion while maintaining accuracy throughout the design flow.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-1038990"></a>Multi-Mode Simulation Toolbox for MATLAB</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1039015"></a>Multi-Mode Simulation toolbox for MathWorks MATLAB reads PSF and SST2 files directly in MATLAB. You benefit from the set of MATLAB mathematical functions to post-process simulation results from Spectre Circuit Simulator, Spectre APS, Spectre XPS, and AMS Designer. All sweep types are supported in the toolbox, including Monte Carlo and parametric. Special data structures are used to store RF signals and harmonics resulting from PSS and QPSS analysis. Furthermore, the Spectre Simulation toolbox complements the rich MATLAB libraries with communication product-specific post-processing functions such as Fast Fourier Transform, third-order intercept point, and 1dB gain compression point.</p>

<h4>
<a id="pgfId-1039092"></a>Post-layout Simulation</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1039113"></a>The Spectre Circuit Simulator enables analog and RF block and subsystem post-layout verification with speed near that of pre-layout simulation. An accurate parasitic reduction technique enhances the simulation performance of parasitic-dominant circuits by a significant amount over traditional SPICE-level simulation.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1039100"></a>The technology enables designers to trade off accuracy and performance using a simple user-friendly setup.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-1041978"></a><a id="63044"></a>Spectre Netlist Format</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1042012"></a>A netlist is an ASCII file that lists the components in a circuit, the nodes that the components are connected to, and the parameter values. The netlist is created in a text editor such as <code>vi</code> or <code>emacs</code> or from one of the environments that support the Spectre simulator. The Spectre simulator uses a netlist to simulate a circuit.</p>

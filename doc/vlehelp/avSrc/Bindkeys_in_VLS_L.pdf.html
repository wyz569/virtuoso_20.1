Bindkeys in Virtuoso Layout Suite
This document lists the default bindkeys defined for Virtuoso Layout Suite. Bindkeys tie commonly-used commands to single keys, key combinations, or mouse
sequences. They can be used to automate repetitive tasks and speed up your work.
In this document, bindkeys are arranged:
❍

As a Keyboard Layout

❍

By Mouse Functions

❍

By Miscellaneous Keys

❍

By Functions

Note: To use bindkeys in Layout XL or Layout EXL, you must first define them in Layout XL or Layout EXL, if not already defined. Bindkeys registered earlier using the Layout Viewer
are no longer supported in Layout XL or Layout EXL.

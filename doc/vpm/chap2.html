<p>
<a id="pgfId-902182"></a>If the power intent for a design is available in the required (1801) formats, you can import it to update the design with the specified power intent. For this, it is required that the cellview is editable. You can import the power intent to specify it for a cell being instantiated in the design. If you create instances of an IP block in the design for which power intent is available in a 1801 or Liberty file, you can import the file and update the design as per the power intent in the file. This helps in correctly connecting the power domains of the IP to the power domains of the top-level design. In addition, you can register special low power cells that are imported from the library. </p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-940947"></a><a id="45640"></a>Import Flow</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-940731"></a>You can import the power intent and utilize it in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-940757"></a>Use the power intent specified for a design in the top-down power propagation scheme. If you have a hierarchical schematic design for which the power intent is available in a 1801 file, you can import the 1801 file and update the power connectivity of each hierarchical block used in the design as per the power intent. This enables in correctly connecting the power domains of the IP to the power domains of the top design (SOC or a chip).</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-940735"></a>If you have a digital block with a Verilog netlist available from a digital place and route tool, supply connectivity can be built for this block by using the Cadence Verilog Import flow along with the initial imported power intent available for SOC where the digital block is integrated. This defines the power requirements across digital and analog boundaries. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-947564"></a>Register special low power cells that are imported from a 1801 special cell definition file. The registered details are consumed by all the designs that use this file for creating the power connectivity of the cells as per their power domains. The special cell definition file is registered to be included as per the setup. For details, refer to <a href="chap1.html#73071">Supply Set and Power Domain Registration</a>.</li></ul>


<p>
<a id="pgfId-940963"></a><a id="vpmUIImportPowerIntent"></a>The illustration below gives an overview of the import flow.</p>

<a id="pgfId-941052"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="327" src="images/chap2-2.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-941056"></a>Here are the key stages of the import flow.</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-941057"></a>Traversal of design hierarchy to find supply net expressions and explicit terminals.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-941058"></a>Standard and special cells identification using Liberty models or the 1801 special cell definition file.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-941059"></a>Reading the input 1801 power specification. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-941060"></a>Creation and optimization of the redirected netSets.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-941061"></a>Creation of the top-level supply ports and supply nets. </li></ul>




<p>
<a id="pgfId-937378"></a>To import the power intent for the currently open cellview, click <em>Power Manager</em> &#8211; <em>Import Power Intent</em>. It opens the Import Power Intent form. Browse to open the 1801 file.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-938031"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="302" src="images/chap2-3.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-941474"></a>The currently opened cellview details are specified in the form automatically. The <em>View List</em> specifies the switch view list sequence as mentioned in the setup. For details, refer to <a href="chap1.html#11636">Miscellaneous Settings</a>. Specify the name of the 1801 file in the <em>1801 File</em> field. Alternatively, browse to select the 1801 file to import the power intent for the design. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-941970"></a>The <em>Resolve Top netSets</em> check box controls the creation of the global net along with the port creation. Select the check box if you do not want the global net to be created along with the associated supply ports defined in the input 1801 file. A local net is created that is associated to each supply port created in the schematic. This mode can be used during the 1801 import for IP integration and extract power intent at the top level. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-941950"></a>Deselect the check box if you want a global net expression to be created instead of a local net that is associated with supply ports. Also, corresponding to each unique supply net that is defined in the 1801 file, pins are created. The pin creation is controlled by&#160;&#160;  <a href="VPM_envVars.html#48650">createExtractionLogFile</a>.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-942067"></a>The following illustration shows the output for the supply port VDDA import when <code>createPinsOnImport</code> has been set and <em>Resolve Top netSets</em> is deselected.</p>

<p>

<div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-information">
<a id="pgfId-941476"></a>
Alternatively, the <a href="VPM_SKILL.html#50817">vpmImportPowerIntent</a> SKILL function has been provided to import the power intent information for a cellview. </div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-942213"></a>The following tasks constitute the import flow in Power Manager:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-942214"></a>The power intent is read from the 1801 file and is updated in the design with all the 1801 commands supported by Power Manager. All unsupported commands or unsupported arguments of the supported commands are flagged in the log. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942215"></a>Elaboration and traversal of the complete design hierarchy is done to identify the standard and special cells that have an associated Liberty model or a special cell definition file. This is done for the supply and topology recognition. These cells are considered as stop cells and the tool does not traverse through these cells for power/ground nets. Only the top level is read to collect the supply information (inherited nets or explicit terminals), which is further mapped to the power/ground information specified in the Liberty model or the special cell definition file.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942216"></a>In a hierarchical design for cells that do not have an associated Liberty or a special cell definition, supply nets information is gathered from the different levels of hierarchy. Power Manager traverses down the hierarchy to the level where it finds supply nets of inherited nets (Net Expressions) or explicit supply terminals.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942217"></a>netSet properties are created in the design hierarchy, wherever required. This enables the top-level block to be instantiated in another top-level SoC schematic. The inherited pins are created in the block schematic. The inherited terminals have the same name as the supply nets in the 1801 file. For details about the criteria of creating redirected netSet properties, refer to Redirected netset property creation and optimization.    </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942218"></a>The tie connections are resolved in the design hierarchy. For details about the resolution of tie connections, refer to Resolving Tie Connections in the Design.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942219"></a>Supply pins are created corresponding to the power domain nets and global nets during 1801 import by reading the <code>create_supply_port</code> and <code>create_supply_net</code> commands for a successful LVS check. <br />
<a id="pgfId-942220"></a>Refer to the following scenarios that are considered while creating the pins.<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-942221"></a>If a pin already exists and it belongs to the same net as mentioned in the 1801 file, it is used.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942222"></a>To create an inherited pin, a pin that exists in the same net as mentioned in the 1801 file is used. However, the pin net should be global and should match the power domain net for which the pin needs to be created. The pin is converted into an inherited pin by associating a terminal net-expression with the existing pin. If the existing pin is already an inherited pin but with the different net-expression, the net-expression is replaced. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942223"></a>All pins created during the 1801 import are removed when you click <em>Remove Power Intent</em>. If any pin existed prior to import and was converted to an inherited pin or the net-expression was changed, it is converted back to a normal pin or the original net-expression is restored, respectively. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942224"></a>For the 1801 import flow, pins are not created in the design schematic for the supply nets that do not have a corresponding <code>create_supply_port</code> command in the input 1801 file. These supply nets are internally generated supply nets that have a corresponding <code>create_supply_net</code> command in the input 1801 file.</li></ul><br />
<a id="pgfId-942225"></a>The direction of the pins created aligns with the direction specified in the <code>create_supply_port</code> command in the input 1801 file.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942226"></a>The special cell rules are read as specified in the input 1801 file to create the corresponding supply connections and resolve them for the top supplies. For more information refer to Special Cell Handling for Import flow.<br /><div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-tip">
<a id="pgfId-942227"></a>
It is recommended that after importing a 1801 file, you run <em>Check &#8211; Hierarchy</em> or the <em>File &#8211; Check and Save</em>. These commands create nets corresponding to the netSet properties and set the signal type of power nets and ground nets according to the power intent.</div></li></ul>














<h2>
<a id="pgfId-942804"></a><a id="12955"></a>Redirected netSet Property Creation and Optimization</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-942805"></a>While creating the supply connectivity across the design hierarchy, there could be conflicts where the same net expression property gets resolved to different supply nets at the top. For correct supply connectivity resolution in such scenarios, a redirecting netSet property is created and an optimization algorithm is executed to ensure that the redirection of netSet property happens across the design hierarchy only where required. Redirection is done where having a pure global net expression can cause issues in the supply connectivity across the design hierarchy. This ensures minimum number of netSet properties at the top instance.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-943422"></a>Wherever the property name is created, the prefix is added as mentioned in the setup to identify various <code>pg_type</code>. Redirected property name is realized as <code>[@Prefix_cellname_count:%:topsuplyname!]</code>. The illustration below represents the creation of redirected netSet property in the design.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-942228"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="627" src="images/chap2-7.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-941465"></a>In a design if there is a hierarchy and no Liberty stop cell, Power Manager traverses to the level where net expressions exist. Or, if the net expressions are already redirected to have different property names, it is the reference for the tool to make the connectivity.</p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-942849"></a><a id="21075"></a>Resolving Tie Connections in the Design</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-942871"></a>In a Verilog netlist if an input pin of a standard cell instance or a special low power cell, such as level shifter or isolation cell instance, is connected to a numerical constant <code>1&#39;b1</code> or <code>1&#39;b0</code>, the input pin gets connected to a global supply net in the schematic created after Verilog import using Verilog In. The name of the global supply net is specified at the time of Verilog import. After Verilog import, all such input pins connect through a common wire creating tie connections. The label of the common wire matches the global supply net name.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-942872"></a>To avoid shorting of nets after importing the 1801 file, it is important that all such pins are connected to wire stubs with a label. However, the wire stubs are not physically connected to each other. To achieve this, use the two connect by name options, <em>Connect Power Net By Name</em> and <em>Connect Ground Net By Name</em>, during Verilog import. This connects each tied-off input pin with the wire stub that has a label. It enables you to modify the tied-off input pin connections without creating incorrect connectivity in the design through shorting of the nets during the 1801 import.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-942910"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="437" src="images/chap2-8.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-942914"></a>To resolve the tie connections of various instances, all the labels that require an update are identified during import. The labels on the wire stubs that are attached to the tied-off input pins are updated. These labels present at the top level or in the lower level block are identified for updates based on the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-942915"></a>The label is attached to a wire, which has one end point floating (not connected to anything) and the other end point connected to an instance. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942916"></a>The wire net is <code>power</code>, <code>ground</code>, <code>tieHi</code>, or <code>tieLo</code> according to sigType or name-based registration.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942917"></a>Wire net has the netType property.</li></ul>


<p>
<a id="pgfId-942918"></a>Wire net having the netType property is one of the conditions because it ensures that the label and wire have been added using Verilog In. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-943741"></a>It avoids modification of labels in standard cells, for example, an inverter schematic can have terminal MOS devices with bulk/source/drain terminals connected to wire stubs that have a label, and the wires are of type <code>power</code>, <code>ground</code>, <code>tieHi</code>, or <code>tieLo</code>.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-942919"></a>Once the target wire label is identified, it is updated based on whether it is a top-level label or a sub-block label. </p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-943826"></a>The top-level wire labels are updated as the power/ground nets according to the 1801 file definition, as shown below.<br />
<a id="pgfId-942921"></a> <div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="412" src="images/chap2-9.gif" /></div></li><li>
<a id="pgfId-942950"></a>The sub-block wire labels are replaced with a net expression label that is unique for that block as shown below.<br />
<a id="pgfId-942980"></a><div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="388" src="images/chap2-10.gif" /></div></li></ul>









<p>
<a id="pgfId-942867"></a>This net expression can be resolved to its final power/ground value with the help of a netSet property added to the parent instances in the hierarchy above.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-943013"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="348" src="images/chap2-11.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-943017"></a>The final resolution of the tie connections in schematic designs to the appropriate power and ground nets mentioned in the 1801 file is aligned to the following rules: </p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-943018"></a>For standard cell instances, the tie connection at the input pin is resolved with the power/ground net of the power domain of the instance.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943019"></a>For isolation instances, the enable pin with tie connection at the input pin is resolved with the power/ground net of the always-on power domain of the isolation instance.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943020"></a>For enabled level shifter instances, the enable pin with tie connection is resolved with the power/ground net of the output power domain of the enabled level-shifter instance.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943021"></a>For isolation and level shifter combo cell instances, the enable pin with tie connection is resolved with the power/ground net of the input power domain of the enabled level shifter instance.</li></ul>




<h2>
<a id="pgfId-942995"></a><a id="94104"></a>Handling of Low Power Special Cells</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-943055"></a>The 1801 import flow supports the following low power special cells:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-943056"></a><strong>Level Shifter</strong> <br />
<a id="pgfId-943057"></a>Import 1801 flow supports different level shifter configurations, such as single rail, dual rail and enabled single /dual rail (combo cell). For each level shifter instance, the load and drivers along with their power domains are determined and the netSet properties are created based on the criteria mentioned below. <ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-943058"></a>If a level shifter cell is connected to a standard cell or port at both ends, the load and driver domains are used to resolve PG connections. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943059"></a>If a level shifter instance is a multi-rail cell, the driver domain resolves the input supply connections and the load domain resolves the output supply connections. Level shifter rule specified in the input 1801 file enables in determining the load and the driver domains. The rule is considered to find the supply set based on <code>input_supply_set</code> and <code>output_supply_set</code> argument. Level shifter rules are specified in input 1801 as: <br /><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943060">
<a id="pgfId-943060"></a>set_level_shifter ls_rule -domain pd_ls -applies_to inputs -rule low_to_high -location self -input_supply_set SS_VDD_VSS -output_supply_set SS_VDDA_VSS</pre>
<a id="pgfId-943061"></a>If not specified, Power Manager finds the driver and load supply set for the level shifter by traversing the design path and resolving the connectivity accordingly.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943062"></a>If a level shifter instance is a single-rail cell, the load domain resolves the output PG connections. <code>input_signal_level</code> is required in the Liberty model of the level shifter to identify the cell type as single rail level shifter.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943968"></a>If a level shifter instance is connected to an isolation cell at one end, the load or driver domain on the other end is determined. If the driver domain is known, it resolves the input supply connections. If the load domain is known, it resolves the output supply connections. <br /><div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">
<a id="pgfId-943064"></a>A single-rail level shifter cell has only output supply. </div></li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943065"></a>If a level shifter instance is connected to an isolation cell at one end, the power domain for the end connected to the isolation instance is determined from the isolation instance. Therefore, the power domain at the isolation cell intersection is the same as the power domain of the isolation cell itself.</li></ul></li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943067"></a><strong>Isolation cell</strong><br />
<a id="pgfId-943068"></a>Initially, the load and driver of the isolation cell are traced and then, the netSet properties are created based on the criteria mentioned below. <ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-943069"></a>If an isolation cell is connected to a standard cell or a port on both the ends, the power domains of the load as well as the driver are used to resolve the PG connections and create netSet properties. </li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943070"></a>If an isolation cell instance is a multi-rail cell and has a switchable power or ground pin, then the switchable domain is used to resolve the switchable PG connections. The non-switchable domain resolves the non-switchable PG connections.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943071"></a>If an isolation cell instance is a single-rail isolation cell, only one of the load or driver domain that is non-switchable is used to resolve the PG connections. The isolation rule specified in input 1801 file assists in determining the load and the driver domains. The rule will be considered to find a supply set based on isolation_supply_set defined in the isolation rule. Isolation rules are specified in input 1801 file as:<br /><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943072">
<a id="pgfId-943072"></a>set_isolation ISO -domain PD_VDD_VSS -location self -elements {I1/In} -isolation_supply_set SS_VDD_VSS -isolation_signal I0/en -isolation_sense high -location self</pre><br /><div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">
<a id="pgfId-943073"></a><code>isolation_supply_set</code> is required if <code>default_isolation</code> is not mentioned in the power domain stated in the input 1801 file.</div></li></ul></li></ul>






















<div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">
<a id="pgfId-947031"></a>You can provide an expression containing multiple pins for enable in the <code>tech.upf</code> file for isolation cells and level shifter cells.

<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-943075"></a><strong>Power Switch</strong><br />
<a id="pgfId-943076"></a>For power switch, the load and drivers supply along with the control net are determined and the netSet properties are created accordingly. The power switch rule specified in input 1801 file enables in determining the load and the driver domains. The rule is considered to find a supply set based on <code>input_supply_port</code>, <code>output_supply_port</code> and <code>control_port</code>. <br />

<p>
<a id="pgfId-943157"></a>The import 1801 flow in Power Manager also supports a hierarchical 1801 input file. A hierarchical 1801 has the <code>load_upf </code>and <code>set_scope</code> commands which set the scope to each of the specified list of instances and executes the set of 1801 commands in the child 1801 file, specified as the argument of the <code>load_upf</code> command. Upon return, the current scope is restored to what it was prior to invocation. Supply nets and ports will be created for load_upf/set_scope block, based on the <code>create_supply_net</code> and <code>create_supply_port</code> commands mentioned in the parent 1801 file, along with that, it will also obey the settings for <a href="VPM_envVars.html#48650">createExtractionLogFile</a> and ResolveTopNets.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-943158"></a>For all the instances in the design, domain assignment is based on <code>create_power_domain</code> and if no element has the power domain specified, it will belong to default power domain. In case there is no default power domain in the scope, then its upper scope default power domain will be looked at to assign the power domain.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-943153"></a>Honoring Command Sequence and Precedence</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-943189"></a>The traversal of the input 1801 file in the import flow follows a set of the below-mentioned rules related to the command sequence and their precedence. </p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-943191"></a>Any explicit assignment of the elements (instances) in the <code>create_power_domain</code> command takes precedence over the extent that includes elements (instances) as a part of that power domain. <br />
<a id="pgfId-945385"></a>If there is an existing explicit domain assignment with <code>create_power_domain</code> in the elements section, irrespective of the ordering of <code>create_power_domain</code>, <code>set_scope</code>, or <code>load_upf</code> commands, the precedence of scope is defined by the nearest ancestor that has an explicit domain assignment using <code>create_power_domain</code>.<br />
<a id="pgfId-944435"></a>This can be shown in the following case considering the sequence of commands in the input 1801file:<pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943192">
<a id="pgfId-943192"></a>set_scope &quot;/&quot;</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943193">
<a id="pgfId-943193"></a>create_power_domain PD2 -elements {I0/I2} &#8230;.</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943194">
<a id="pgfId-943194"></a>create_power_domain PD1 -element { . } ....</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943195">
<a id="pgfId-943195"></a>set_scope &quot;I0&quot;</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943196">
<a id="pgfId-943196"></a>create_power_domain PD3 -elements {.} &#8230;.</pre>
<a id="pgfId-943197"></a><strong>Result:</strong> I0/I2 gets assigned to the power domain PD2 and not PD3</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943199"></a>Explicit assignment of multiple domains to the same instance is an error and 1801 stops the import process. This can be shown in the following case:<br /><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943200">
<a id="pgfId-943200"></a>set_scope &quot;/&quot;</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943201">
<a id="pgfId-943201"></a>create_power_domain PD1 -elements {I0} &#8230;.</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943202">
<a id="pgfId-943202"></a>set_scope &quot;I0&quot;</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943203">
<a id="pgfId-943203"></a>create_power_domain PD2 -element { . } &#8230;.</pre>
<a id="pgfId-943204"></a><strong>Result:</strong> Error case</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-943206"></a><code>connect_supply_net</code> always takes precedence over <code>create_power_domain</code>. If there are more than one <code>connect_supply_net</code> commands for the same supply net, the last command in the order is honored. In case of multiple <code>connect_supply_net</code> commands, the last command is applicable.<br /><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943207">
<a id="pgfId-943207"></a>set_scope &quot;/&quot;</pre><pre class="webflare-pre-block webflare-courier-new" id="#id943208">

<a id="pgfId-945358"></a><strong>Result:</strong> I0/vdd is connected to VDD2</li></ul>

<a id="pgfId-943211"></a><a id="20874"></a>Removing the Imported Power Intent</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-943252"></a>To remove the updates done in the design using Import 1801 flow, which include newly created pins, nets, net expressions, and netSet properties on the blocks, you can use the Remove Power Intent option. This removes these objects and restores the previous state of the design before the importing the power intent. This can be accessed from the Power Manager menu and the Power Manager toolbar.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-938260"></a>Remove the power intent information from the design by using <em>Launch</em> &#8211; <em>Power Manager</em> &#8211; <em>Remove Power Intent.</em></p>

<a id="pgfId-1095437"></a>You can use Verifier in a top-down, bottom-up, or mixed verification flow for your analog and mixed-signal designs. Verifier lets you set up a verification project with many blocks having multiple verification requirements owned by multiple team members. You can map these requirements to their corresponding simulation setups, which are referred to as implementations. You can simulate the implementations to gather the results. Then, you can review the overall verification status of the entire project, and drill down to the detailed status of each verification requirement in the requirements hierarchy. You can customize Verifier to suit your project. It is possible to reuse your verification setup for other projects to improve the verification quality.</p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-1092308"></a><a id="75061"></a>Introducing Verifier</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092309"></a>With advanced nodes, and a multitude of performance and reliability requirements, analog designs and their verification flows are becoming more complex. The analog components mostly work together with highly complex digital components, creating a mixed-signal system-on-a-chip. As a result, the quality requirements of verification flows are escalating. For example, international standards mandate that companies record all the verification steps for automotive electronic and electrical safety-related systems. Other industry segments have similar standards and requirements. Therefore, managing a design verification project can be challenging, especially when multiple designers are involved in the project containing many design blocks.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092310"></a>With increasing verification requirements, project managers, verification leaders, and designers need a comprehensive and scalable verification solution for their analog-centric IPs. Such solutions are also essential for business success as re-spins are no longer acceptable for designs, such as the design of a mixed-signal system-on-a-chip.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092311"></a>To augment Virtuoso with features that offer a complete analog design verification solution, Cadence provides Virtuoso ADE Verifier (Verifier). Verifier is a comprehensive application to conduct and monitor requirements-driven verification flows for analog designs. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092312"></a>You can use Verifier to meet the following objectives for your design verification flows: </p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092313"></a>Define the verification requirements for a design project.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092314"></a>Map the verification requirements with their implementations, which can be ADE Assembler and ADE Explorer cellviews of the type <code>maestro</code>, their tests, and outputs.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092315"></a>Specify references of requirements when multiple designers are involved in the project.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092316"></a>Simulate multiple implementation cellviews individually, serially, or in parallel.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092317"></a>Perform and monitor large, batch-based verification regression runs.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092318"></a>Review the overall verification status of the entire project, and drill down to the detailed status of each verification requirement through various reports.</li></ul>





<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092874"></a>Verifier maintains verification data in cellviews of the type <code>verifier</code> that contain:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092320"></a>The verification requirement plan, structured as a hierarchy of requirements</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092321"></a>Implementation links and the mapping between the requirements and their corresponding implementations</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1092322"></a>Verifier settings, such as the default job policy to use, the source for verification specifications that Verifier uses to determine verification results, among other details</li></ul>


<p>
<a id="pgfId-1093478"></a>You can use the advanced features of Verifier to accommodate the unique needs of your verification project. For example, you can add custom fields that are specific to your project and manually sign off requirements. Verifier also lets you create owner cellviews of the type <code>verifier</code> based on the owners of the requirements. This feature helps project managers assign owners to design verification requirements and monitor the verification status of the owned requirements. Requirement owners can create implementations and map them to their requirements.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1093427"></a>Verifier offers a configurable environment and full data access through an extensive set of SKILL functions. For details on these functions with examples, see <em><a actuate="user" class="URL" href="../verifierSkillRef/verifierSkillRefTOC.html" show="replace" xml:link="simple">Virtuoso ADE Verifier SKILL Reference</a></em>. </p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-1092327"></a><a id="11300"></a>Understanding the Key Elements of Verifier</h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1093813"></a>Verifier uses the following key elements to provide the design verification infrastructure:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1093134"></a><a href="overview.html#48762">Requirements</a></li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1093155"></a><a href="overview.html#26748">Implementations</a></li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1093266"></a><a href="overview.html#69484">Verification Status and Reports</a></li></ul>



<h3>
<a id="pgfId-1093213"></a><a id="48762"></a>Requirements<a id="reqTree"></a></h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1094420"></a>A design verification plan includes a set of verification requirements structured in a hierarchical tree. The terms <em>verification plan</em> and <em>requirements hierarchy</em> are interchangeable. A verification requirement is an abstract description of an aspect of a design that needs to be verified, along with its details. It includes details like the title, description, and verification type with the applicable range of acceptable output values. In a multi-user design environment, requirements can be referenced. You can also specify custom fields to include additional information.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092332"></a>Verifier lets you capture the verification requirements of a design in a hierarchy and provides the mechanism to use them as the base to analyze the verification results. This approach helps implement a requirements-driven verification flow.</p>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-1093754"></a>Example</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1093755"></a>Consider that one of the first verification requirements of a design is to check the analog parametric AC behavior of a block. Under this, you can check the AC gain, DC gain, and bandwidth. </p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1093759"></a></p>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-1092338"></a><a id="26748"></a>Implementations</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092339"></a>A verification implementation represents the simulation setup, testbench, and the measured output of a requirement. Implementation data is stored in cellviews of the type <code>maestro</code>.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092340"></a>You map requirements to the corresponding implementations. To determine if a design verification requirement has been verified or has failed verification, you run the simulation tests associated with the mapped implementations. Verifier compares the outputs of these tests with the specification values set in the related implementations or requirement and determines the verification results.</p>
<div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">
<a id="pgfId-1092341"></a>Verifier supports the checks and asserts defined in cellviews as implementations.</div>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-1092342"></a>Example</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1093556"></a>Consider that the test output of the <code>maestro</code> cellview of the block that captures the DC gain you want to verify is as follows:</p>

<pre class="webflare-courier-new codeContent">
<a id="pgfId-1092343"></a>opamp090/full_diff_opamp_AC/maestro/Active.opamp090:full_diff_opamp_AC:1.<strong>DCGain</strong></pre>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092344"></a>You can map this implementation of the output to the requirement <code>ID1.1.2</code> for DC gain verification.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092348"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="329" height="79" src="images/overview-5.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092349"></a>Also, the output result must meet a specification to pass verification. You can set this specification in the requirement or the implementation. Consider that the specification is that the result should be more than 25 units (&gt;25).</p>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-1092350"></a><a id="69484"></a>Verification Status and Reports</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092351"></a>Verifier presents the overall requirements-based design verification status and detailed verification results in HTML format. It also displays simulation details of implementations.</p>

<h4><em>
<a id="pgfId-1092352"></a>Example</em></h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1093570"></a>Once you run the implementation cellview, you can check if the DC gain requirement that you set failed or passed. The following figure represents how you can review the status of the DC gain requirement directly from Verifier. You can also access details from the other reports that Verifier provides.</p>

<h2>
<a id="pgfId-1092360"></a><a id="72430"></a>Using Verifier in Design Verification Flows<a id="flows"></a></h2>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1092361"></a>You can customize the use of Verifier according to your design verification needs. For example, you can use Verifier in a top-down flow where you define requirements before you add their implementations, which are stored in cellviews of the type <code>maestro</code>. Alternatively, you can use Verifier in a bottom-up flow where you add implementations before you start developing the verification plan in the form of requirements hierarchy. You can also use Verifier in a meet-in-the-middle flow that has a mix of the top-down and bottom-up elements. </p>
<div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">
<a id="pgfId-1092362"></a>The top-down flow is recommended when you want to reuse a verification plan in different projects. Use the bottom-up flow if the design project is in progress and implementations already exist. </div>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1095592"></a><a id="loadData"></a>When you launch a <h-hot><a href="getStarted.html#startVerifier">new Verifier setup</a></h-hot>, Verifier initially prompts you to open an existing Verifier cell view. If you specify a cellview name that is not available in the selected library, Verifier prompts you to include implementations for a bottom-up flow, include requirements for a top-down flow, or start Verifier without any data.</p>

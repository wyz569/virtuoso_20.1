<p>
<a id="pgfId-1064167"></a>You use the <em>Floorplan</em> &#8211; <em>Soft Block Update</em> commands to adjust soft blocks in the design.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1080223"></a>You can use these commands to remove soft block overlaps, snap soft blocks to the routing grid or manufacturing grid, pull soft blocks to the core area, and to push the top-level implementation of power structures to the block level. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1064183"></a>The <em>Floorplan</em> &#8211; <em>Soft Block Update</em> menu provides the following sub-options:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1064189"></a>Push Pre-Routes: Pushes the top-level implementation of power structures to the block level.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1064191"></a>Adjust Blocks: Adjust soft blocks by abutting and pushing the blocks.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1064192"></a>Remove Block Overlap: Remove overlaps in blocks.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1064193"></a>Snap Soft Blocks to Grid: Pulls soft blocks to manufacturing or placement grid.</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1068540"></a>Pull Soft Blocks inside PR Boundary: Pulls soft blocks inside the PR boundary.</li><li>

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-1064190"></a><a id="79911"></a>Push <a id="pushsbform"></a>Pre-Routes</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1064196"></a>During floorplanning, you often need to push the top-level implementation of power structures to the block level. Floorplanner provides the <em>Push Pre-Routes</em> command that enables you to do this. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1068616"></a>You can use this command to push the following objects to the block level:</p>
<ul><li>
<a id="pgfId-1066188"></a>Path</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1066190"></a>Path segment</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1066191"></a>Rectangle</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1066192"></a>Custom and standard vias</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1074437"></a>Custom and Standard rows</li><li>
<a id="pgfId-1075950"></a>Blockages<br /><div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-information">
<a id="pgfId-1077826"></a>
The <em>Push Pre-Routes</em> command can be used for pushing only orthogonal paths, routes, and path segments to the block level.</div></li></ul>








<p>
<a id="pgfId-1066189"></a>If the Power - Ground Net(s) option is selected in the Push Into Blocks form, then the supported objects can be pushed only if the nets corresponding to these objects have the &#8216;ground&#8217; or &#8216;power&#8217; signal types. However, if the Regular (non-Power/Ground) Net(s) option is selected, then the supported objects can be pushed only if the nets corresponding to these objects have the signal types, such as &#8216;tieHi&#8217;, &#8216;tieLow&#8217;, &#8216;clock&#8217;, and &#8216;signal&#8217;. In addition, the supported shape objects should be on the layers for which the layer function in the technology file is defined as &#8216;metal&#8217;. The <em>Push Pre-Routes</em> command pushes the top-level power structures down to one level only. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1066208"></a>Depending on whether the soft block instance is fed by the top-level net to which the objects are attached to, the <em>Push Pre-Routes</em> command pushes the top-level power structures to the block level as-is or as routing blockages. If the soft block instance is fed by the same top-level net, the net geometry (associated vias and supported shape objects) are pushed as they are. In this case, square pins are created at the intersection of the net geometry and the PRboundary. These pins are created inside the PRboundary. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1066306"></a>If the soft block is not fed by the same top-level net, the power structures are pushed as routing blockages. </p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1069326"></a>Power geometries that are close (within the maximum of the minSpacing value) to the PRboundary, but are placed outside the PRboundary, are pushed as routing blockages. Vias that have connectivity with routes are pushed as three routing blockages.</p>

<div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">
<a id="pgfId-1078533"></a>Stand-alone vias that do not have connectivity with any route or path or pathSeg are not pushed into blocks.</div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1066350"></a>The following table summarizes the behavior.</p>

<a id="pgfId-1078212"></a>(ICADVM20.1 Only) <em>Push Width Spacing Pattern</em>: Pushes top-level WSP patterns into sub-blocks such that the top-level WSP pattern and the soft block WSP pattern are aligned.

<h3>
<a id="pgfId-1075645"></a>Adjust Bloc<a id="adjustBlocks"></a>ks</h3>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1064199"></a>The <em>Adjust Blocks</em> command enables you to adjust the existing floorplan by abutting and pushing the soft blocks in the design. These commands work only in the pre-selection mode.</p>
<p>
<a id="pgfId-1067930"></a>When you invoke the Adjust Blocks command by clicking <em>Soft Block Update </em>-&gt; <em>Adjust Blocks</em>, the Floorplan toolbar expands to display the Adjust Blocks sub-toolbar. You can invoke the Adjust Blocks sub-toolbar by clicking the Adjust Blocks icon as well. The following graphic shows the sub-toolbar.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1065146"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="90" src="images/chap8-9.gif" /></div>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1064280"></a>The <em>Adjust Blocks</em> command supports three sub-commands, such as <em>Abut</em>, <em>Push</em>, and <em>Push Max</em>, and each sub-command supports four actions, such as up, down, left, and right. These commands enable you to operate on the selected block when you click the arrow icons. For example, to abut a soft block to the bottom of the design PRboundary, select the soft block and click the down arrow icon. The soft block abuts to the bottom of the design PRboundary.</p>

<div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">
<a id="pgfId-1075748"></a>The PRboundary can either be rectangle or rectilinear.</div>
<h4>
<a id="pgfId-1065161"></a>Abut</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1065164"></a>Use the <em>Abut</em> option to move the selected block in the specified direction until it abuts another block or the PRboundary. When you abut a soft block, the soft block does not overlap another block or move off the design PRboundary. </p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1065667"></a></p>
<div class="webflare-div-image">
<img width="668" height="253" src="images/chap8-10.gif" /></div>
<h4>
<a id="pgfId-1065162"></a>Push</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1065165"></a>Use the <em>Push</em> option to move the selected block in the specified direction by the number of units you specify in the <em>By</em> option. The <em>Push</em> option does not check for overlapping blocks but does not move off the design PRboundary. Each time you click an arrow icon, the selected block moves in the specified direction until it reaches the design PRboundary. If it abuts another block, it pushes the block as well until the adjacent block reaches the PRboundary. If you continue to further push the block in the same direction, the selected block overlaps the adjacent block until the selected block reaches the design PRboundary, as shown in the graphic. </p>

<a id="pgfId-1065234"></a></p>

<img width="668" height="363" src="images/chap8-11.gif" /></div>
<h4>
<a id="pgfId-1065163"></a>Push Max</h4>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1065158"></a>Use the <em>Push Max</em> option to push the selected block in the specified direction until it abuts the PRboundary. This option works the same way as the <em>Push</em> option, except that it pushes the soft block to the PRboundary in one go. If another block lies in the path of the selected block, the <em>Push Max</em> option pushes the block to the PRboundary. The <em>Push Max</em> option ensures that the soft block does not overlap another block or move off the core area.</p>

<p>
<a id="pgfId-1064201"></a>Use the <em>Remove Block Overlaps</em> command to place overlapping hard blocks and soft blocks adjacent to each other. This command works on pre-selection as well as post-selection modes. To remove overlaps, select the overlapping soft blocks and then click the <em>Floorplan &#8211; Soft Block Update &#8211; Remove Block Overlaps</em> command. </p>

<div class="webflare-information-macro webflare-macro-note">

<a id="pgfId-1076616"></a>If the soft block is a digital soft block, it is snapped to the placement grid. Else if the soft block is a custom soft block, it is snapped to the manufacturing grid. In the following graphic, Block1 is a digital block and when the <em>Snap Soft Blocks to Grid</em> command is used, Block1 is snapped to the placement grid (represented by the x in the graphic).
